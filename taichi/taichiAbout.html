<hr>

<p>
The purpose of this website is to present taichi chuan-related resources. Because
there exist many different transcriptions, pronunciations and translations of
Chinese characters, some information is usually lost in the translation of 
Chinese documents and it is not always clear whether similar sounding
transcriptions of Chinese characters refer to the same or different concepts.
Ultimately, clarity is only provided if one can check whether the same Chinese
characters are used.
</p>
<p>
This website provides Chinese texts with literal translations. The idea
is that taichi chuan learners who do not speak and read Chinese but want more clarity
about the core taichi chuan concepts have a web resource where they can compare English
and Chinese versions of the texts. In contrast to translations of these texts
on other websites, this website attempts to provide mostly literal translations which
align Chinese and English words so that the translation becomes more direct
and provides insights about how the concepts are expressed in Chinese.

<h4>What is Wu Cheng style?</h4>

On this website, the name <b>Wu Cheng</b> is used for Cheng Tin Hung's
version of Wu style. Other names for this style are Wutan,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wudang_tai_chi_chuan">Wudang Tai Chi Chuan</a>
or <a href="http://www.taichichuan.co.uk/">Practical Tai Chi Chuan</a>. 

<h4>Simplified and Traditional Chinese Characters, Pinyin</h4>

Many of the listings in this website are provided in traditional and 
simplified Chinese characters. Simplified characters are used in mainland
China, traditional characters as used in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The characters
are transcribed in Pinyin which is the mainland Chinese standard.

<h4>Form Names</h4>

Even within one style, different instructors use slightly different versions
of the form names. Only one representative form will be chosen for each style and
weapon. The names in taichi chuan forms tend to be poetic whereas the wushu forms
tend to be more descriptive (the first two characters describing the stance,
the next two characters describing the hand movement).

<h4>Software</h4>

This website uses purpose-built 
software (MySQL database, web scripts, software for Chinese/English translation 
and Unihan-based character conversion). See the
<a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page for further information.

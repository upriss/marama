This website has been created by Uta Priss (Email: <img src="emadr.gif">).

<p>

Uta has been practicing martial arts for more than 20 years, including
Wushu, Five Animal Kung Fu and Aikido. She studied
Taichi Chuan with <a href="http://www.wutan-taichichuan.co.uk/">
James Connachan</a> since 2006. James learnt his Taichi Chuan from 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheng_Tin_Hung">Cheng Tin Hung</a>,
Ian Cameron and 
<a href="http://www.taichichuan.co.uk/">Dan Docherty</a>.

<p>

This style of Taichi Chuan is based on Wu style and is commonly
called Wutan,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wudang_tai_chi_chuan">Wudang Tai Chi Chuan</a>
or <a href="http://www.taichichuan.co.uk/">Practical Tai Chi Chuan</a>. On this
website, the name <b>Wu Cheng</b> is used because it reflects Cheng Tin Hung's
version of Wu style.

<p>

In 1989, Uta participated in the German National Wushu Championship (in 
M&ouml;nchengladbach) and won first prize in the women's broadsword competition
and third prize in the women's Changquan (long fist) competition. She
qualified as an instructor at James Connachan's Taichi Chuan school.

<p>

In her other life, Uta is a computer scientist and can be contacted about
IT consultancy for the technologies used on this website (web design,
web scripting, MySQL databases, Chinese/English translation software,
Unicode and Unihan-based treatment of Chinese characters).
